# Titanic Survival Predictions

This is the first machine learning web app i was able to deploy using streamlit and heroku. 

This app is a working extention of model 2 in the jupyter notebook i made for predicting survivors using classification trees. This project was originally an assignment in CST 383 Data Science at California State University Monterey Bay, but i went ahead and took it a step further to create this web app. [link](https://github.com/dblilienthal/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/titanic_classification_trees.ipynb)
